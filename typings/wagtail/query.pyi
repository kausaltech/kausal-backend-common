        Find the first ancestor that all pages in this queryset have in common.
        For example, consider a page hierarchy like::

            - Home/
                - Foo Event Index/
                    - Foo Event Page 1/

                    - Bar Event Page 1/
                    - Bar Event Page 2/

        The common ancestors for some queries would be:

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> Page.objects\\\n            ...     .type(EventPage)\\\n            ...     .first_common_ancestor()

            <Page: Foo Event Index>

        This method tries to be efficient, but if you have millions of pages
        scattered across your page tree, it will be slow.

        If `include_self` is True, the ancestor can be one of the pages in the
        queryset:

        .. code-block:: python

            >>> Page.objects\\\n            ...     .filter(title__contains='Foo')\\\n            ...     .first_common_ancestor()

            <Page: Bar Event Index>

        A few invalid cases exist: when the queryset is empty, when the root
        Page is in the queryset and ``include_self`` is False, and when there
        are multiple page trees with no common root (a case Wagtail does not
        support). If ``strict`` is False (the default), then the first root
        node is returned in these cases. If ``strict`` is True, then a
        ``ObjectDoesNotExist`` is raised.
